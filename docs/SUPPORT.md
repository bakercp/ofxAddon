# Support

First, read [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) and see the [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide. If that doesn't help and you're sure it's a bug, create an [issue](../issues). 

If you have more general questions about how to to use the addon, post questions on the [openFrameworks forum](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/) and @ tag the author (the same as the author's gihub username) so everyone will benefit from the conversation. Please do not email the author directly with questions.
