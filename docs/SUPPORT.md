# Support

First, read the [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) guide and see the [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide. If those doesn't help and you're sure it's a bug, create an [issue](../../../issues). 

If you have more general questions about how to to use the addon, post questions on the [openFrameworks forum](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/) and @ tag the author (the same as the author's gihub username) so everyone will benefit from the conversation. Please do not email the author directly with questions.
